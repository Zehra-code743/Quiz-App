🧠 AI System Architect Specification
Project: Streamlit-Based PDF Study Assistant (Gemini OpenAgents SDK)
Version: Ultra-Clean Zero-Bloat Architecture
1. System Objective

Design a minimal, fast, production-clean intelligent study companion that:

Core Tasks

Extracts text from academic PDFs.

Produces structured study notes and concept summaries.

Generates MCQ/mixed-format quizzes.

Runs fully in Streamlit with a smooth, distraction-free UI.

Uses Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash) through OpenAgents SDK — not OpenAI SDK.

No TensorFlow.
No heavy PDF libraries.
No extra dependencies.

Only:
streamlit, PyPDF2, openai-agents, python-dotenv.

2. Architectural Summary
A. Core Engine

Powered by a single intelligent agent:

📌 StudyAgent

Model: gemini-2.0-flash

Wrapped using OpenAgents SDK

Tools bound:

extract_pdf_text (PyPDF2)

summarize_text (Agent)

generate_quiz (Agent)

Agent System Prompt:

“You are a Pedagogical AI System.
First summarize the input text into clear study notes.
Then generate an assessment-quality quiz based strictly on the text.”

B. Application Components
1. tools.py

Contains the lowest-level utility functions:

Function	Responsibility
extract_pdf_text(path)	Read PDF → plain text
clean_text(text)	Remove extra spaces, artifacts
format_quiz_output(raw)	Convert agent JSON → readable quiz
2. agent.py

Defines the Gemini agent:

Responsibilities:

Initialize OpenAgents Agent.

Register all tool functions.

Provide run_summary(text) and run_quiz(text) wrappers.

Ensure consistent request format to Gemini.

3. app.py

Provides backend functions for Streamlit:

Responsibilities:

Handle uploaded PDF.

Call tools & agent methods.

Preprocess and store session state.

Deliver clean outputs to UI.

4. main.py

Streamlit UI layer:

Responsibilities:

PDF uploader

Summary viewer

Quiz generator button

Light/Dark toggle

Responsive layout + scrollable sections

3. Folder Structure

│── .gemini/
│     └── settings.json
│── gemini.md
│── main.py
│── pyproject.toml
│── README.md
│── .env
└── uv.lock

4. Detailed Functional Architecture
tools.py — Utility Layer
Responsibilities

Be extremely small + fast.

Follow Zero-Bloat rule.

Only handle raw operations (PDF → text, formatting).

Contents

Extract PDF text.

Clean text.

Format quiz from agent output.

agent.py — AI Reasoning Layer
Responsibilities

Create and configure the Gemini agent.

Bind tools according to OpenAgents SDK syntax.

Provide two public methods:

agent_summary(text)

agent_quiz(text)

Behavior

Always summarize first.

Then generate quiz.

Use the same text extracted from PDF.

app.py — Business Logic Layer
Responsibilities

Glue between UI and agent.

Load PDF and extract text.

Request summary from agent.

Request quiz.

Cache results in Streamlit session_state.

Outputs

Clean summary

Clean quiz

Stable error-free execution

main.py — Streamlit Interface Layer
Responsibilities

Full user experience.

File upload widget.

Summary container.

Quiz container.

Modern UI (cards, subtle shadows, dark mode).

Calls methods from app.py.

Sections

Header

Upload Area

Summary Card

Quiz Card

6. Example End-to-End User Flow

User uploads "Chapter 3 – Neuroanatomy.pdf".

Text extraction using PyPDF2.

Agent receives text → produces summary:

Key points

Definitions

Concepts

Quiz generated (MCQs mixed with reasoning questions).

UI displays:

Scrollable summary card

Quiz card with answers hidden

7. Testing Scenarios
Test	Expected Result
Small PDF	Summary + quiz instantly
Large PDF (50 pages)	Summary concise, quiz accurate
Complex formatting	Cleaned text output
Repeated uploads	Session state resets cleanly
Missing PDF	Graceful stop
8. Unique Improvements Over the Original Version

✔ Fully architected like an enterprise AI system
✔ Four-layer structure (tools → agent → app → UI)
✔ Standardized agent prompts and workflows
✔ Modular design for future scaling (memory, RAG, etc.)
✔ Professional system-level documentation
✔ Zero-bloat enforced at architectural level
✔ Clean abstraction boundaries
✔ Ready-to-implement code files

✅ If you want, I can now generate:
Option A — Full working code for all files (main.py, agent.py, tools.py, app.py)
Option B — pyproject.toml + README.md
Option C — Entire zip folder structure with code
Option D — Same architecture but with streaming responses
